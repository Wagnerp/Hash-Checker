Hash-Checker
============

Fairly simple console app which generates checksums against a file passed as an argument to it and attempts to compare the generated checksums against a checksum contained in the clipboard. Currently supports MD5, SHA-1, and SHA-512, and has a .reg file which can be modified to add the application to the Windows context menu.
